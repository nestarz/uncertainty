<!--
Directions:
- Did I killed someone by butterfly effect ?
- Will I killed someone ? based on my past and attitude ?
- Do I have false-memory about not killing someone ?

Notes:

Maybe make a chatbot, asking precise questions (1), asking to upload files (audio, video, and text).
The chatbot maybe is not a messaging app, but more a http://www.herstorygame.com/about/ experience.
So its a non-linear, investigation, maybe link it to personal data
- map your gps data with criminality areas ?
- use a kind of https://dataselfie.it/#/ extension to monitor your browsing, interests and correlate it murder.
- use fingerprint sensor or a fake dna analyzer to identify if you are a killer.

Analyze them.
Make an AI (fake it ?) that determine if you killed someone, with a classification rate.
Use research papers of criminology to automate the investigation.

Reveal [False_memory_syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory_syndrome).
Criminlaity laws: What evidences make you a culprit ?

(1) Precise questions:
- Have you ever dreamed of killing someone? A member of your family?
- Please, face the camera and say loudly: I didn't killed someone.
- Say it again.
- Define a MBTI.
